The DBs in this directory are all made of information 
which we have gathered from Wikipedia with different versions
of our code.

db1.csv & db2.csv are the older versions, which have a lot of
random values which have very low relevancy to our project.
This is because we scraped Wikipedia pages in a random manner
that got us a lot of irrelevant information.

wikipedia1.csv & wikipedia2.csv are the newer versions.
Both of them have a higher rate of relevancy to our project,
and that is because we scraped pages by an order of magnitude.
Here we only started scraping the pointers of a new page, after
we have completely scraped the pointers of the former page.

This directory contains the process of
creating the required files for a Gephi graph.
The current nodes.csv & edges.csv were created
using all of the existing 7500+ values and
197K+ pointers.
This graph proved to be overwhelming in density
and as such not really valuable for our research.
After asking for Dr. Omer Tzok's advice, we've
decided to reduce the amount of nodes to the 10%
with the top relevancy score to our project.

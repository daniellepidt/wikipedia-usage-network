This directory contains files similar in to the
04_graph_dbs, only here we have the 10% most
relevant values to our project.
We've decided to create this differentation
after asking for Dr. Omer Tzok's advice.
This way we have a Gephi graph with 750~ nodes,
which is a more reasonable number to deal with
in a visual graph.
